I am an Associate Professor in the Colledge of Economics at Aoyama Gakuin University. I have studied the internationalization of Japanese firms and the impact of globalization on inequality, using Japanese micro data. I have also studied trade in cultural goods and the impact of natural disasters on manufacturing establishments. I am currently working on the ownership structure of foreign direct investment using firm-level data.
